Ranking Prompt: Based on the following project details and the 3 identified keywords of expertise needed, rank the potential collaborators from best to worst. Provide a detailed explanation for each collaborator's ranking, emphasizing how their expertise aligns with the identified expertise gaps. Consider the relevance of their expertise as the primary factor, and also weigh fairness criteria such as gender, age, and racial diversity. 
Given that the last author and the first author typically have the most significant impact on the paper, these roles should be given special attention in your evaluation. 

### Three Feedback Keywords Context:
Three key expertise gaps have been extracted from the reviewers' feedback using the following process:
- Reviewers provided feedback on the project, identifying areas of improvement and limitations.
- Based on this feedback and the current team's expertise, three specific expertise areas were identified that would improve the project's chances of success:
   - Three Feedback Keywords: {'Keyword1': 'Physician engagement strategies', 'Keyword2': 'Mixed-methods research design', 'Keyword3': 'Qualitative data analysis in healthcare'}.

### Instructions for Ranking Collaborators:
1. **Review the Provided Data**: You are provided with data about each collaborator, including their expertise, publication record, and other relevant details.
   - Carefully review this data and the three key expertise gaps identified in the reviewers' feedback.
2. **Focus on Expertise Relevance**: For each collaborator, evaluate how well their expertise aligns with the three identified gaps.
3. **Evaluate Other Criteria**: In addition to expertise relevance, assess each collaborator based on the following criteria:
   - **Alignment with Expertise Gaps**: How closely does this collaborator's expertise address the three identified gaps in the project? Evaluate whether their skills are directly relevant to solving the limitations outlined in the feedback. Collaborators with expertise that fills these gaps should be ranked higher.
   - **Impact on Project Success**: Assess the collaborator's potential contribution to the success of the project. Consider how their previous work, publications, and reputation in the field could enhance the project's outcomes. Focus on their ability to bring unique perspectives or methods that could significantly improve the quality and innovation of the research.
   - **Fairness and Inclusivity**: Consider how this collaborator's inclusion promotes diversity within the research team. Assess the importance of diversity factors such as gender, race, and age in building a more inclusive and representative research environment. Rank collaborators higher if they contribute to making the team more diverse and inclusive.
   - **Potential Risks or Limitations**: Identify any concerns that could hinder successful collaboration with this individual. This could include factors like a mismatch in research priorities, potential conflicts of interest, time constraints, or challenges related to communication. Weigh these factors carefully and rank collaborators lower if there are significant risks or challenges.
4. **Provide Detailed Explanations**: For each collaborator, provide a thorough explanation of their ranking. Ensure your explanation is backed by data and is detailed in addressing:
   - How their expertise addresses each of the three identified gaps.
   - Their strengths and weaknesses across the other evaluation criteria.
5. **Be Objective and detailed**: Base your ranking on **the data provided** and how well their expertise aligns with the gaps identified from the reviewers' feedback.
   - You must **ensure that the collaborator's name and ID are correct** for each entry. Each collaborator can only hold one rank from 1 to 20.
   - The ranking must be from 1 to 20, where each collaborator is ranked only once.
